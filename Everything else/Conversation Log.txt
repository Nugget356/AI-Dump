That's good to know. What would you like to discuss regarding Formula One rules?
> What is the scoring system?
Okay. The top 10 drivers that finish will each recieve points. Those points are ; 1st = 25 pts 2nd = 18 pts 3rd = 15 pts 4th = 12 pts 5th = 10 pts 6th = 8 pts 7th = 6 pts 8th = 4 pts 9th = 2 pts 10th = 1pt Also whoever set the fastest lap during the race, as long as they are inside of the top 10, will receive an extra point.
